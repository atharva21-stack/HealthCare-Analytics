## Technologies Used

The Realtime HealthCare Analytics project employs a range of technologies to enable real-time healthcare data analytics and visualization. Here is an overview of the key technologies used:

- **Python**: The project is primarily developed in Python, making use of its robust ecosystem for data processing, analytics, and visualization.

- **aiokafka and asyncio**: Real-time data streaming is achieved through aiokafka and asyncio, which allow efficient asynchronous processing and handling of data streams.

- **Docker and Docker-compose**: These technologies are used for containerization and orchestration, simplifying deployment and scalability.

- **Cassandra Database**: Cassandra is used for data storage and retrieval, ensuring a scalable and reliable database solution for healthcare data.

- **Interactive Dashboard**: The project features an interactive and intuitive dashboard for monitoring patient data, likely implemented using web development technologies (specifics may vary).
